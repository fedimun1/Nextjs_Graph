# Graphs with Next.js

This project is a sample application created to demonstrate how to draw Pie, Line, and Bar graphs using Next.js. It's designed to help the community understand how to integrate `chart.js` and `react-chartjs-2` for dynamic and interactive data visualizations.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash



npm install chart.js react-chartjs-2
Project Structure

    Create a components Folder
    Inside the src directory, create a folder named components:

    bash

src/
└── components/

Create Chart Components
Inside the components folder, create the following components for each chart type:

    PieChart.tsx: This component will be responsible for rendering a Pie chart.
    BarChart.tsx: This component will be responsible for rendering a Bar chart.
    LineChart.tsx: This component will be responsible for rendering a Line chart.

The structure should look like this:

bash

src/
└── components/
    ├── PieChart.tsx
    ├── BarChart.tsx
    └── LineChart.tsx
